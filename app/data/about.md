#### Intro
I am Amine, a professional and independent self-motivated Software Developer. I have a passion for building things, and a drive for constant improvement and learning. My passion has taken me towards a more research focused setting for the last couple of years, but now that my thesis is almost over, I think I will put my PhD on the back burner and get back into pure software development, to the pressure of the deadlines and the awesome people that you can only meet in tech.
<br>
I added this page because so many people complained that my site was just a resume!
<br><br>
#### Currently
I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at [Concordia Univeristy](https://www.concordia.ca/) where I work on creating tools and logics for model checking Multi-Agent Systems (MASs), under supervision of [Dr. Bentahar](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~bentahar/). In addition to research, the biggest part of my work has been as a java developer, creating tools for model checking MASs or working on model-based automatic test generation.
<br><br>
I will defend my research thesis by the end of june 2020, and expect to be available for hire by July 2020. I am particularly interested in a position as a Java Developer in the Montreal area, but what I'm really looking for is an awesome team and a motivating position.
<br><br>
I am also available to consult on interesting projects. I am particularly interested in education, avionics systems, and finance. I may even be available for pro-bono work depending on the project and the time commitment.  If you would like to arrange a meeting, I am based in Montreal but travel to Morocco (my home country) frequently.

#### Some history

- At 6, I used a computer for the first time. I played [superfrog](https://www.dosgamesarchive.com/download/superfrog/), and I was hooked forever.

- At 7, I finished my first game [prince of persia (1989)](https://www.retrogames.cz/play_102-DOS.php?language=EN) while at summer camp.

- At 8, I couldn't sleep all night after I played [Resident Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil_(1996_video_game)), my first ever horror game.

- At 9, I learned chess from my cousin. It went on to become one of my favorite hobbies. 

- At 10, we bought our first computer, a Dell Pentium III at the time.

- At 11, I got a pink floppy disk as a gift, and won my first and last school soccer tournament, it was the year.

- At 12, I set the all-time high record at my local video-game facility by beating [King of Fighter 97](https://www.retrogames.cz/play_102-DOS.php?language=EN) in record time using only [Chris](https://hero.fandom.com/wiki/Chris_(The_King_of_Fighters)).

- At 13, I wrote my first calculator in  [pascal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language)).

- At 14, I participated in my first local olympiad of mathematics, I went on to the regionals the year after and met some friends for life. 

- 14 - 17, I played a lot of video games. My favorites included Prince of Persia, Resident Evil 4, the Commandos series, Wolfenstein, and Age of Empires 2.

- At 15, I got accepted into a high-school for gifted children and left home for good. I met some people that inspired my entire life since.

- At 16, I learned HTML and CSS, and created a few websites and animations for fun.

- At 18, I failed to make the Moroccan team for the International Mathematical Olympiad, my first ever heartbreak.

- At 19, I learned the C language, and later went on to learn c++, and created my first tank 2D game a year later.

- At 20, I learned Java and Neural Networks, and created my first GUI tool to predict the weather based on historical data. This went on to become my project for [TIPE](https://www.scei-concours.fr/tipe.php) on my final year in preparatory classes.

- At 21, after failing [Concours Centrale-Supelec](https://www.concours-centrale-supelec.fr/), I decided to go to join [INPT](https://www.inpt.ac.ma/) instead of going to finish my studies in France.

- At 22, I joined my first programming club, participated in my first competitive programming marathon, and first competitive programming local contest.

- At 22, I also became interested in research, and went on to have my first summer internship in a research setting. I worked on [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) back before any books were published on the subject, and browsers hadn't even agreed on a single API. I used WebRTC and NodeJs to create a video conferencing app at the time.

- 22 - 24, I learned about programming, took courses in C, C++, Java, Assembly, JEE and Spring. I become passionate about programming, and decided to pursue it as a career.

- At 23, I became the president of our university's programming club, joined the student association as the head of the Student Life and Culture committee, and became student representative in the university council. Our team also won third place at the [Moroccan Collegiate Programming Contest](https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/finder/MCPC-2014), and qualified to represent Morocco in the [Africa and Arab Collegiate Programming Contest](http://acpc.global/). We couldn't make it to Egypt though because of funding problems.

- At 24, our team won 2nd place in the [Moroccan Collegiate Programming Contest](https://icpc.baylor.edu/regionals/finder/MCPC-2014), but couldn't make it to the [AACPC](http://acpc.global/) again because of the instability in the region back in the arab spring. We were heartbroken especially since the ICPC finals were organized in Morocco.

- At 24, I also became interested in formal verification in general, and model checking specifically. I ended up with a research internship in Canada working on MASs a year later, published my first research [paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-25524-8_37), and joined a Master's degree under the same supervisor a year later. The rest is history as they say.

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.
